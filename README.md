## About me
Hello to you, whoever might be reading this. I am Hans Aguilar, a Software Development student living in Winnipeg, a city in Canada located in the province of Manitoba.

As a student, I am a developer who likes to create unconventional web designs based on things I have seen, such as my calculator site that resembles Windows, as well as my own spins on certain ideas like search engines. I also enjoy assisting others with their code if I can.

The programming languages I have used in the past include C#, Java, and JavaScript. I also have experience in using CSS and HTML. Thank you for taking the time to read about me and I hope you have a nice day.
