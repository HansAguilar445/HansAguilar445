# About me
Hello to you, whoever might be reading this. I am Hans Aguilar, a Software Development student living in Winnipeg, a city in Canada located in the province of Manitoba.

As a student, I am a developer who likes to create unconventional web designs based on things I have seen as well as my own spins on certain ideas. I also enjoy assisting others with their code if I can.

The programming languages I have used in the past include C#, Java, and JavaScript. I also have experience in using CSS and HTML. If you would like to add my skills to your team, please send me an email. I await your message.
